eCommerce shop for a power tools manufacturer.

An e-commerce website for a leading electrical industry company and one of the largest power tools dealers in MD.
The e-commerce website is coupled with a content management system and deployed on a static hosting provider, which empowers the team to:

 - Manage a growing inventory of over 900 products.
 - Automatic deploys
 - Static builds
 - Track stock and inventory via a third-party API
 - Reducing hosting costs while speeding up load times

The main challenges were:
 - Tracking prices and stocks amount from external service
 - Handle a growing inventory of products
 - Allowing the team to manage multiple product categories, spec sheets, blog posts, etc.
 - Having a SEO oriented strategy while being able to execute rapidly

This was a time-critical project that went from requirements elicitation to the mocked up designs, polishing and then using Gatsby.js and Strapi to build it.

Ultimately, I delivered a website with:
 - CMS backend - Powered by Strapi, deployed on Heroku
 - E-commerce Frontend - Built with Gatsby and Deployed via Netlify
